== Generate a Changelog for a GitHub Milestone

To generate a markdown changelog that comprise the list of bugs and issues in a GitHub milestone follow these steps:

- Download a https://github.com/spring-io/github-changelog-generator/releases[release JAR] or use the https://hub.docker.com/r/springio/github-changelog-generator/[Docker image].
- Configure the application with the following properties:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  repository: owner/name
github:
  username:
  password:
----

NOTE: When generating a changelog for a public repository, the `username` and `password` properties are optional.
However, specifying them ensures that you don't hit https://developer.github.com/v3/?#rate-limiting[GitHub's rate limit] easily.

If you're using GitHub enterprise, the base url can be set using `github.api-url`.

TIP: If you are only configuring a few properties you can alternatively use application arguments such as `--changelog.repository=...`.

- Run the following commands:

----
$ java -jar github-changelog-generator.jar <milestone> <path_to_generate_file>
----

NOTE: By default `<milestone>` refers to the milestone title.
If you want to use milestone ID, you should set the `changelog.milestone-reference` property to `id`.



=== Customizing Sections
By default the changelog will contain the following sections:

|===
|Title |Label Text

|":star: New Features"
|"enhancement"

|":lady_beetle: Bug Fixes"
|"regression" or "bug"

|":notebook_with_decorative_cover: Documentation"
|"documentation"

|":hammer: Dependency Upgrades"
|"dependency-upgrade"
|===

The title is in https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown[Markdown] format and emoji like ":star:" can be used.
If you want something different then you can add `sections` YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  sections:
  - title: "Enhancements"
    labels: ["new"]
  - title: "Bugs"
    labels: ["fix"]
----

By default, adding sections will replace the default sections; to add sections after the defaults:

[source, yaml]
----
changelog:
  add-sections: true
----

You can also customize the contributors title using:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  contributors:
    title: "Contributors"
----

You can add external links such as release notes for quick access using:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  external_links:
  - name: "Release Notes"
    location: "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes"
----




==== Showing Issues in Multiple Sections
Unless otherwise configured, issues will only appear in the first matching section.
For example, if you have an issue labeled with `enhancement` and `documentation` then it will only appear in the "New Features" section.

If you want an issue to appear in multiple sections, you can use the `group` property.
Groups allow you to create logical groupings of related sections.
An issue may only appear once in any given group.

For example, you might define the following:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  sections:
  - title: "Highlights"
    labels: ["noteworthy"]
    group: "highlights"
  - title: "Enhancements"
    labels: ["new"]
  - title: "Bugs"
    labels: ["fix"]
----

This will create two distinct groups, "highlights" and "default" (which is used if no `group` property is specified).
An issue labeled with `new` and `noteworthy` will appear in both the "Highlights" and "Enhancements" section.



=== Excluding Issues
Issues and pull requests can be excluded from the changlog by configuring exclusions.
You can ignore all items that have certain labels using `changelog.issues.exclude.labels`.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  issues:
    exclude:
      labels: ["wontfix", "question", "duplicate", "invalid"]
----



=== Excluding Contributors
If you have contributors that you don't want to thank (perhaps core team members or bots), you can set the following:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  contributors:
    exclude:
      names: ["dependabot"]
----

You can also use `*` if you want to drop the contributors section entirely.



=== Sorting Issues
By default issues are sorted by their "created" date.
If you want to order them by title instead you can set `changelog.issues.sort` to `title`.
It's also set the property on section configuration if you want ordering per section:

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  sections:
  - title: "Bugs"
    labels: ["bug"]
  - title: "Dependency Upgrades"
    labels: ["dependency"]
    sort: "title"
----



=== Following Ported Issues
If an issue is forward-ported or backward-ported between milestones, you might have separate issues in each milestone that reference the original issue.
To credit a contributor in the changelog for every milestone that includes a forward or backward port of the issue that was resolved, configure the labels that are used to identify ported issues.
The body of a ported issue should contain a comment with a reference to the original issue, which is extracted using a regular expression with exactly one capture group for the original issue number.

[source,yaml]
----
changelog:
  issues:
    ports:
      - label: "status: forward-port"
        bodyExpression: 'Forward port of issue #(\d+).*'
      - label: "status: backport"
        bodyExpression: 'Back port of issue #(\d+).*'
----
