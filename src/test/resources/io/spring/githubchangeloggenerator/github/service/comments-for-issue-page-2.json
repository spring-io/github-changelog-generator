I am not against providing more flexibility in that area but I'd like we take a step back and we look at your use cases first. Given that `provided` isn't transitive and that you add them in a project that generates \"an app\" (since the `repackage` goal is involved), I'd like to understand what is flagged as `provided` and why.\r\n\r\nCan you share more details please?",

The idea is that some of the dependencies are only used for certain features in the project and will not be needed if that feature isn't used. Ideally, such a feature would be split into a sub-module that depends on the core functionality project. This new subproject would have only non-optional dependencies, since you'd need them all if you decided to use the subproject's functionality.\r\n\r\n>However, since the project cannot be split up (again, for whatever reason), these dependencies are declared optional. If a user wants to use functionality related to an optional dependency, they have to redeclare that optional dependency in their own project. This is not the clearest way to handle this situation, but both optional dependencies and dependency exclusions are stop-gap solutions.\r\n\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html\r\n\r\nI would agree with you if we would be talking about the `provided` scope \r\n",
